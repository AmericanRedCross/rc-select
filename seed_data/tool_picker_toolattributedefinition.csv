1,"I have a very small budget. I am looking primarily for a very low cost or free solution (or mix of solutions) that will allow my team to manage data without paying much for either the set up or maintenance. Ideally I would find a tool that doesn't have any sort of cost to license, host, or use.",2023-12-12 14:17:37.000 -0600,2024-01-15 19:13:20.176 -0600,"I have a small budget (less than $1,000) available to dedicate to a possible solution. The tool needs to have clear pricing that will allow me to estimate the total cost to run and maintain it for the life of my program.","I have a moderate budget (less than $5,000) to cover expenses related to my data management solution. While I prefer to keep costs low, I may have some flexibility if a given solution meets all of my needs.","The emergency response operation or program is large enough that we can likely afford a high cost and fully-featured solution. We could likely spend $10,000 or more if the tool can handle a variety of functions that we might otherwise pay separately for.",The relative cost of setting up and maintaining the tool throughout the complete tool implementation lifecycle.,"I don't have much time. Spinning up an instance of the tool must be done in a matter of hours, and tweaking it to meet my needs has to be a matter of pointing and clicking through a simple interface.","I'm in a rush, but have at least a few days to handle the configuration, including building out the data model to match the program.","I have some flexibility and at least a week before I need the tool up and running. Setup can be slow due to dependencies outside of my control, and I have time to consult necessary technical experts that might need to help with the configuration process.",I have lots of flexibility to ensure I take the time needed to carefully configure the system. I have two weeks or more to be very deliberate with the set up process.,"Teams frequently face deadlines for getting a system up and running, and there are a variety of factors that can impact the time it takes.","Our program must adhere to strict standards, such as GDPR, where people have clearly-established rights around their data, including a right to access, rectify, erase, export to other platforms, request that data not be further processed, lodge a complaint through official channels, and more. Therefore, any data management solution needs to have robust closeout procedures that can securely erase or transfer data back to any relevant parties.","We are dealing with highly-sensitive information about people, and when the program closes, we need to be absolutely sure that no local copies are maintained on people's computers or in any cloud server. Our team plans also plans on repurposing some of the data, either for analytical purposes or as part of a migration of beneficiary data to another program.","It would be nice to have a tool that can store the data in an open format that other tools are capable of utilizing, rather than being locked into a proprietary format on a specific platform, so that when we close out the program we can continue to utilize the data if we choose.","Once our program is complete, we will have no need for reusing the data that has been collected. Furthermore, we aren't concerned about any of the data we collected might persist once we close out our work.","At the end of a program or emergency response operation, you likely will be left with a large dataset of potentially sensitive information. In the context of a data management solution, closeout refers to how easily the tool lets you manipulate, migrate, and/or responsibly delete data while being confident that the tool isn't accidentally maintaining a copy locally or in the cloud.",I need to plan for an operating environment that is extremely cutoff from telecommunications systems. The tool needs to be able to run locally on a computer without an internet connection.,"Though the tool will be mostly used in no- or low-bandwidth environments, we will be able to periodically access the internet to upload/download data from a cloud server, but won't be able to interact with any websites in realtime.","We are mostly working in areas where connectivity will not be a concern, but aren't quite ready to go for a completely web-based solution. The tool will ideally store data in the cloud in order to facilitate access for end users that may be spread out, but still offer offline-functionality for certain interactions.",Connectivity is not going to be an issue. I can consider solutions that are completely web-based and require an active and high-bandwidth internet connection.,"Connectivity in this context refers to how easily data can be sent from one place to another. Some programs or operations may be run out of a national headquarters with good connectivity, while others may be field-based and far from communications infrastructure and therefore need to adapt to an environment with poor connectivity.",Not specified.,Not specified.,Not specified.,Not specified.,Not specified.,"Given the nature of my use case, I anticipate plenty of data cleaning needs. I lack the requisite human resources to use a separate tool to handle this, so I want robust data cleaning to be part of the recommended tool's feature set. Ideally, it will catch data issues without me prompting it, and offer automatic solutions when an issue is detected.","I expect there to be data cleaning needs, and would like a tool that can run reports or similar tools where our team can monitor certain data points in real-time. The criteria for these searches need to be configurable based on our needs. It's ok if we then need to manually correct the data issues that such a search catches.","I don't expect my data cleaning needs to be particularly robust. We likely just need a way to identify duplicates or data entry errors, and can handle fixing those data issues on our own.","Data cleaning either is not an issue I anticipate, or I feel comfortable exporting the data out of whatever tool is recommended and handling it in another tool.","When dealing with larger datasets—particularly those that contain beneficiary information—it is common to run into data accuracy, duplication, and other issues. Some tools may offer data cleaning features, while others will require you to use separate ones to handle these matters.","The tool will be storing sensitive data, such as personally-identifiable information (PII), so it will need to conform to the strictest possible data privacy regulations, such as those laid out by GDPR. The country where the tool will be in use also has laws specifying how and where data can be stored, including regulations on storing PII on servers outside of its borders.","Though our program is not required to adhere to strict data privacy standards like GDPR, we are still seeking a tool that will maintain good practices around how we responsibly collect (and, when necessary, delete) private information in accordance with beneficiaries' wishes.","We have some concerns around how data is collected and how it is used, but don't believe this is a serious enough factor to heavily influence the recommendation process.",We are working in an area or on a project where digital privacy regulations benefiting the people who shared the data are not a concern.,"Data privacy involves handling, processing, storage, and usage of data in compliance with various laws and regulations which benefit people whose information we're collecting. Some use cases may require stricter adherence to certain requirements than others.","We expect a number of strict data protection requirements. We need control over specific user roles that limit the ways they can interact with sensitive data, and full audit logs of each action a user takes. The tool needs industry-standard data protection policies, including enterprise-grade data storage and security, robust access control, and constantly-updated measures kept in line with evolving threats to keep hackers out. It must also pass periodic, third-party security audits.","Any cloud-based solution must have modern security measures in place, and the ability to limit access and read/write permissions. Though I don't require a tool with adherence to certain industry-standards, I still expect it to have high-quality tools in place to prevent bad actors from accessing or manipulation data.","Given the nature of the data we plan on using this system for, we aren't overly concerned about data protection. However, we still expect that the tool's developer has clearly articulated their data protection strategy and security policies.",I don't need to consider data protection features.,"Data protection refers to the protective measures implemented to safeguard data from unauthorized access, data breaches, or theft. It's about protecting data from malicious threats, such as hackers or cyberattacks. Data security encompasses a range of technologies and practices like encryption, access control, network security, and security policies.","Data visualization features will be extremely important to end users and audiences that will be reviewing this program. We lack the time and/or capacity to create these, and need a tool that will offer graphs, charts, maps, via pre-built templates that require minimal technical or data visualization expertise.","Data visualization features will be extremely important to end users and audiences that will be reviewing this program. We need a tool that will allow us to create data visualizations natively, but we also have the time and resources to manually configure these and do not require pre-built templates.","Our team will want to visualize this data, but don't necessarily need to the proposed platform to handle it for us. We need to be able to either build a live connection to the data for business intelligence tools like PowerBI, or be able to create dashboards or static visualizations from manually-exported data.","We don't anticipate needing any data visualization, but if we do, our team is able to create them without needing direct access to the underlying data.","Data management tools can become rich repositories of your programmatic information, and making sense of it is much easier when you visualize it. Some tools may offer powerful features out of the box to create dynamic visualizations like maps and dashboards, while others will require you to handle data visualization on your own using other tools.","I need complete flexibility with the data. Our teams will want to export data from wherever the tool is storing it into a number of other formats, including both proprietary (e.g. .xlsx, .docx) and open (e.g. .txt, .svg) formats. Data extraction must be a robust and built-in feature for the tool. The proposed solution must also have powerful data export functionality, including either an API or a custom report tool.","Our team will need to extract the data from the platform on a limited basis into formats that are either proprietary (e.g. .xlsx, .docx) or open (e.g. .txt, .svg), but it's acceptable if the tool manages data in such a way that not all of it can be exported. For example, if we have beneficiary lists with headshots, I would be ok with not being able to export the images and just get a CSV of the beneficiaries.","Most of the work that requires access to the data can be done directly inside the proposed solution. I'm not concerned about the specific formats that the data can be exported into, just that there is a way of getting data out for either analytical or archival purposes.","I'm not concerned about being locked into a single ecosystem, and do not anticipate needing to extract or move data from the proposed solution to another platform.",Some companies and tools may rely on business models that lock users into specific ecosystems and either require you to pay to convert the data so that it can be used with other tools or simply don't allow you to migrate the data elsewhere. Interoperability in this case describes how easily you can export or reference data in the proposed solution with other tools you may wish to include as part of a suite of tools to meet your programmatic needs.,"I need a tool that has many different language options (beyond the four official IFRC languages). The localization features must allow for non-English speakers to configure and maintain the system, as well as any other users like program staff to interact with it. All elements, from navigation options to documentation, must be available in the language I specify.","The tool must be fully-translated into all four of the official IFRC languages, at a minimum.",The tool must be available in at least one other common language besides English.,English-only tools are fine.,"Given the nature of Red Cross Red Crescent operations, your solution may require that it be accessible in a variety of languages. Localization refers to whether a tool has already been translated into other languages.","I need a ""set it and forget it"" solution. Our team needs to have the tool set up and then be able to focus solely on program implementation—we have little bandwidth to manage the run and maintain phase of the tool.","While we prefer a tool that is simple to maintain, we do have some resources available to manage the system after it has been set up. That doesn't mean we can tinker with computer code or other technically-intensive tasks, but we can make small tweaks to the configuration as needs arise.","We need a tool that can be adjusted as the program is carried out, and have at least one person on our team that can handle relatively straightforward maintenance tasks, as long as there is good documentation or support resources.",Our team has a dedicated and highly-capable Information Management specialist that will have the time available to provide ongoing support as needed when critical maintenance tasks arise.,"While setting up a tool may bring certain technical challenges, we cannot overlook the importance of considering the time, money, and human resourcing necessary to keep the system up and running. This may include bug fixes, reconfiguring data models as program plans change, and handling other tasks.","I'm anticipating (or can't rule out) a large and potentially complex program with a number of high performance needs. I need a solution that can scale up as more records are added to the system without greatly affecting speed, efficiency, or cost.","While I am not expecting a massive, years-long use case, I still want to have the flexibility to scale up in the future without too many issues. I might need to store larger volumes of data (e.g. beneficiary photos) or accommodate more complex feature needs.","I'm relatively certain that we have a good sense for what our program looks like and do not anticipate the need for massively scaling up. However, I would like to keep options open for bumping up the performance should teams decide to add additional inputs.",Our program is clearly-defined and I don't anticipate a huge data set or need for expandability. A lightweight solution is welcome.,"As certain inputs increase in whatever your use case may be—beneficiary counts, workflow complexities, number of tranches for cash payments, etc.—a system has to be able to adapt to meet those increases. Larger volumes of data, more end users, bigger lists of cash recipients, and more can all trigger a need for a more performant solution.",I need a solution that is very easy to set up and that requires no special technical skills. The tool needs to offer a pre-configured setup or come from a vendor whose price includes this step.,"Our team feels comfortable with Excel and similar tools that might rely on intermediate knowledge of formulas and spreadsheet manipulation, but would still prefer a straightforward configuration process.","While I would prefer avoiding overly complex configuration processes, we have the human and technical resources available to ensure that any tool we select can be properly configured.",I am an Information Management specialist or have reliable access to someone on my team with that skillset. Complicated configuration processes that might include coding or similarly-advanced experience does not concern me.,"Tools require varying levels of technical experience to configure them to suit the program's needs. Some may offer ""off-the-shelf"" functionality while others might require more advanced Information Management skills like coding to properly get the tool working.","I'm looking for a tool that is extremely well-documented, with extensive online resources that cover everything from setup and configuration to overcoming technical challenges for specific features I want. My end users also need access to some sort of support network or resource that can quickly answer their questions.","I don't necessarily need a bunch of resources like online user support forums or blogs that outline use cases similar to mine, but having good documentation and other available support resources would be very desirable.","At the very minimum, I need a user's manual for how to get the tool set up. I can figure out how to adapt it to my our use-case's specific needs and train end users myself.","I'm not concerned about support and training resources. The people tasked with configuring the system are capable of doing so without support, and end users can either be directly trained by them or are themselves highly technically proficient.","When your team is configuring or using the system, it will inevitably run into issues that will require consulting some sort of documentation or online support. More widely used tools may provide extensive technical documentation and entire online communities dedicated to providing support, while more niche tools may lack these resources."
