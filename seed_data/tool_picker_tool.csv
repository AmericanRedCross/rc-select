2,Excel,"An industry-standard spreadsheet application with a nearly infinite number of use cases. While flexibility is its main strength, it can also be its greatest weakness, since it can be daunting to know where to start. Its popularity means that there are entire online communities dedicated to tutorials and templates, and its integration with other business applications like PowerBI make it an attractive solution for users interested in combining it with other tools.",2023-12-22 15:45:58.000 -0600,1,Uncategorized,1,3,3,3,1,3,2,2,2,2,1,3,Excel-based solutions can either be local (where a single computer or local shared drive hosts the master file) or saved on a cloud-based server like SharePoint.,"Cleaning data is possible with Excel, but like most features for the tool, that must be configured by an end user rather than available out-of-the-box. Formulas for fuzzy-matching similar names, identifying duplicate locations, and other data cleaning techniques would need to be done manually.",No description provided.,"Some security features exist for Excel, but they tend to be rudimentary. You can password-protect a file, but the lack of user-based permissions or user groups that can have specified permission sets makes ensuring data security more challenging.","While Excel offers a variety of charts and graphs for visualizing data, they aren't necessarily the most attractive for externally-facing products. The widely-accessible format of Excel files does, however, make it easy to transfer the data to another tool for visualization.","Excel files are widely-accessible and can be opened by third-party tools, including free and open-source options.","Excel, like all Microsoft Office products, can be used in a variety of languages. The main challenge with a tool like this when it comes to multi-language support is that you typically are locking yourself into just one language. If, for instance, you decide to use the spreadsheet in French, the only best way to handle other languages is to add duplicate columns and rows for each value where you need the same content to be available in other languages.","Complex formulas designed to manipulate data can be sensitive to errors when making changes in Excel, with error messages that might not be intuitive for users without much experience with Excel. Documentation of a given setup is vital for ensuring that an Excel-based solution can be maintained by other users. Users need to be diligent about how and where the file is stored, especially in environments where multiple people have direct access to a cloud-hosted file (e.g. SharePoint), as moving it will break workflows and integrations with things like dashboards.","Excel has limits on the number of rows and columns, but it is unlikely that any project in our industry bump up against those limits (approximately 1 million rows is the cap). The only concern around performance can be speed, particularly when making use of macros, charts, and other elements that can affect performance.","To get started, you need to simply open a new file. However, since it is a blank canvas to work with, the speed may be slower in comparison to other tools since you will need to configure your workbook from scratch.","Getting started with Excel is very fast. However, additional time needs to be added to an estimate to account for the many ways you can configure Excel for use by collaborators such as hosting the file in a shared repository like SharePoint,","Excel is the most popular spreadsheet software in the world, with myriad resources available online. There are entire communities dedicated to educating new users, many of which are freely accessible.","Though the data format of Excel is widely used (.xls files can be opened by other tools, including free and open-source options), transitions can be slightly complicated by how teams may choose to manage their files. Without proper security measures, users may be able to save new versions of the spreadsheet on their own computers, making it more difficult to ensure proper and complete deletion of sensitive data at the end of a project.",1,"Excel is available to all Microsoft 365 subscribers. If a national society does not have access to these licenses, free and open-source alternatives that have similar feature sets can serve as viable alternatives.",3,"While Excel makes it easy for beneficiaries (or whomever you're collecting data on) to insert data via forms, configuring an Excel-based solution that allows them to control the updating, migration, or deletion of their personal data is possible, but very cumbersome and would require a customized and highly-technical solution.",3,A simple and highly-customizable tool built into the Microsoft Office suite of tools.,rc-select.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/excel.png

This makes the system more secure from an unauthorized access perspective, but also means large operations may struggle with this bottleneck.","Set up of RC2 in its current form can be technically challenging as the focus of development has been on making sure it can fill specific RCRC needs, while leaving usability as a lower priority. Some error messages aren't descriptive, and understanding what certain steps are accomplishing can be challenging.","Despite being cloud-hosted, all of the setup must be done on a single laptop, which can produce bottlenecks and mean you have to do these steps sequentially (rather than find efficiencies by splitting up tasks).","RC2 has limited documentation, as it has largely been developed by a very small team.
